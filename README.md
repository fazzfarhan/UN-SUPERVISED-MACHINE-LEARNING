Clustering Algorithm Implementation

A) KMeans Clustering

Description: KMeans clustering partitions the data into K distinct clusters based on the distance to the centroid of the cluster. It iteratively assigns each data point to the nearest cluster center and updates the cluster centers.

Suitability: The Iris dataset is suitable for KMeans because it consists of well-defined clusters in terms of flower measurements, making it easy to partition the data.

B) Hierarchical Clustering

Description: Hierarchical clustering builds nested clusters by either merging or splitting them successively. This creates a hierarchy of clusters that can be represented using a tree-like diagram called a dendrogram.

Suitability: The Iris dataset is suitable for hierarchical clustering because it allows visualization of the nested cluster structure, revealing the relationships between data points.

Dataset: The project uses the Iris dataset, a classic dataset for machine learning, containing measurements of iris flowers.
